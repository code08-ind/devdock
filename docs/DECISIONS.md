# DevDock — decisions

Every new dependency, version pin or deviation from `docs/SPEC.md` / `docs/UI-THEMES.md`.
Dependency and version-pin entries are completed in P0-D (`P0.23`); see also the
"Toolchain / version constraints" list in `docs/PROGRESS.md`.

## P0-B — Electron wiring (2026-10-22)

| Decision | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Closing the main window with **close-to-tray off quits the app** (on both OSes). | BUILD-PROMPTS only says "Closing the window hides it to the tray (configurable)". The hidden palette window keeps Electron alive, so "off" needs an explicit meaning; quitting is the least surprising one. |
| `DEVDOCK_USER_DATA` overrides `userData`, **only when `DEVDOCK_E2E=1`**. | Each e2e run gets a throwaway profile and never touches the real settings, secrets or logs. Ignored in normal runs. |
| E2E hook `globalThis.__devdockTest` (togglePalette, showView, isPaletteVisible, shortcutStatus, userData), only when `DEVDOCK_E2E=1`. | Global shortcuts can't be pressed reliably from Playwright/CI; the BUILD-PROMPTS Done criteria allow an IPC test hook. |
| A palette shortcut arriving via `settings:update` / `import` / `reset` that fails to register is **written back to the last working shortcut** and logged. | Keeps conflict detection (SPEC §6.1) on every path, and the settings file always matches what the OS has registered. |
| Palette window: frameless, always on top, hides on blur, centred on the display under the cursor (all workspaces on macOS). | Spotlight-style UX; not specified. |
| Launch at login is only applied to the OS in **packaged** builds. | In dev it would register the bare Electron binary as a login item. |
| `openExternal` checks `links.allowedHosts` only. | SPEC §5 also allows "hosts from configured services"; no service settings exist yet. Add Bitbucket/Jira/Jenkins hosts to the check in P2–P4. |
| Renderer `index.html` / `palette.html` are placeholders (show `app:info`). | Lets P0-B prove the preload bridge and IPC round trip; replaced in P0-C. |
